Idea:
--User selects state and then selects appropriate airport within state.
-Selection is made by typing in the number listed to the left of each entry name (ex: 10. Florida: user inputs 10)
After selections, user is presented with QuickFly info about the airport: Ident, Name, Tower, WX, and Runways.

Pilot friendly: Pilots will be able to quickly type in 2 numbers, sequentially, and see information that would take significantly longer using on board GPS.
-This notion is exponentially more beneficial to pilot time saving when compared to multiple airports in quick succession. Modern A/C GPS are cumbersome comparatively for finding simple/quick flight data.


Goals
#comments are accomplished/addressed
<!-- 1. Design Folder Structure for project - used bundler to generate. -->
<!-- 2. Connect to GitHub - -->
<!-- 3. File runs program -->
<!-- 4. Stub basic design of functionality -->
<!-- -stub selection menu segment -->
<!-- -finish stubbing second selection menu (remove code from menu 1, call from call method itself) -->
<!-- 5. Scrape from airnav -->
<!-- 6. Code, update, review. In FlyQuick 1.5v, will likely add airport ui upgrades, such as full name displays from menu. -->
<!-- Fix nil return error on wx frequency.: Fixed with 1.01 -->

Notes concerning development
<!-- In further prototypes, perhaps add similar UI friendliness to airport listings (only pilots will know the FAA idents) as done for states--though app is designed for pilots -->
